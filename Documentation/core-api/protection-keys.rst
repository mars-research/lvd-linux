Memory Protection Keys
======================

Memory Protection Keys provide a mechanism for enforcing page-based
protections, but without requiring modification of the page tables when an
application changes protection domains.

Pkeys Userspace (PKU) is a feature which can be found on:
        * Intel server CPUs, Skylake and later
        * Intel client CPUs, Tiger Lake (11th Gen Core) and later
        * Future AMD CPUs

Protection Keys Supervisor (PKS) is a feature which can be found on:
        * Sapphire Rapids (and later) "Scalable Processor" Server CPUs
        * Intel client CPUs, Alder Lake (12th Gen Core) and later
        * qemu: https://www.qemu.org/2021/04/30/qemu-6-0-0/

Pkeys work by dedicating 4 previously Reserved bits in each page table entry to
a "protection key", giving 16 possible keys.

Protections for each key are defined with a per-CPU user-accessible register
(PKRU).  Each of these is a 32-bit register storing two bits (Access Disable
and Write Disable) for each of 16 keys.

Being a CPU register, PKRU is inherently thread-local, potentially giving each
thread a different set of protections from every other thread.

For Userspace (PKU), there are two instructions (RDPKRU/WRPKRU) for reading and
writing to the register.

For Supervisor (PKS), the register (MSR_IA32_PKRS) is accessible only to the
kernel through rdmsr and wrmsr.

The feature is only available in 64-bit mode, even though there is
theoretically space in the PAE PTEs.  These permissions are enforced on data
access only and have no effect on instruction fetches.



Syscalls for user space keys
========

There are 3 system calls which directly interact with pkeys::

	int pkey_alloc(unsigned long flags, unsigned long init_access_rights)
	int pkey_free(int pkey);
	int pkey_mprotect(unsigned long start, size_t len,
			  unsigned long prot, int pkey);

Before a pkey can be used, it must first be allocated with
pkey_alloc().  An application calls the WRPKRU instruction
directly in order to change access permissions to memory covered
with a key.  In this example WRPKRU is wrapped by a C function
called pkey_set().
::

	int real_prot = PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE;
	pkey = pkey_alloc(0, PKEY_DISABLE_WRITE);
	ptr = mmap(NULL, PAGE_SIZE, PROT_NONE, MAP_ANONYMOUS|MAP_PRIVATE, -1, 0);
	ret = pkey_mprotect(ptr, PAGE_SIZE, real_prot, pkey);
	... application runs here

Now, if the application needs to update the data at 'ptr', it can
gain access, do the update, then remove its write access::

	pkey_set(pkey, 0); // clear PKEY_DISABLE_WRITE
	*ptr = foo; // assign something
	pkey_set(pkey, PKEY_DISABLE_WRITE); // set PKEY_DISABLE_WRITE again

Now when it frees the memory, it will also free the pkey since it
is no longer in use::

	munmap(ptr, PAGE_SIZE);
	pkey_free(pkey);

.. note:: pkey_set() is a wrapper for the RDPKRU and WRPKRU instructions.
          An example implementation can be found in
          tools/testing/selftests/x86/protection_keys.c.

Behavior
========

The kernel attempts to make protection keys consistent with the
behavior of a plain mprotect().  For instance if you do this::

	mprotect(ptr, size, PROT_NONE);
	something(ptr);

you can expect the same effects with protection keys when doing this::

	pkey = pkey_alloc(0, PKEY_DISABLE_WRITE | PKEY_DISABLE_READ);
	pkey_mprotect(ptr, size, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, pkey);
	something(ptr);

That should be true whether something() is a direct access to 'ptr'
like::

	*ptr = foo;

or when the kernel does the access on the application's behalf like
with a read()::

	read(fd, ptr, 1);

The kernel will send a SIGSEGV in both cases, but si_code will be set
to SEGV_PKERR when violating protection keys versus SEGV_ACCERR when
the plain mprotect() permissions are violated.


Kernel API for PKS support
==========================

Kconfig
-------

Kernel users intending to use PKS support should depend on
ARCH_HAS_SUPERVISOR_PKEYS, and select ARCH_ENABLE_PKS_CONSUMER to turn on this
support within the core.  For example:

.. code-block:: c

        config MY_NEW_FEATURE
                depends on ARCH_HAS_SUPERVISOR_PKEYS
                select ARCH_ENABLE_PKS_CONSUMER

This will make "MY_NEW_FEATURE" unavailable unless the architecture sets
ARCH_HAS_SUPERVISOR_PKEYS.  It also makes it possible for multiple independent
features to "select ARCH_ENABLE_PKS_CONSUMER".  If no features enable PKS by
selecting ARCH_ENABLE_PKS_CONSUMER, PKS support will not be compiled into the
kernel.

MSR details
~~~~~~~~~~~

WRMSR is typically an architecturally serializing instruction.  However,
WRMSR(MSR_IA32_PKRS) is an exception.  It is not a serializing instruction and
instead maintains ordering properties similar to WRPKRU.  Thus it is safe to
immediately use a mapping when the pks_set*() functions returns.  Check the
latest SDM for details.
