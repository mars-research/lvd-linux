==============================
OVERVIEW
==============================

This code is in arch/x86/lcd-domains/ and arch/x86/include/asm/lcd-domains/.

The main object is struct lcd_arch, defined in
arch/x86/include/asm/lcd-domains/lcd-domains.h.

struct lcd_arch contains the extended page table (EPT) guest physical address
space information, and data for the Intel VT-x virtual machine.

See the comments in the header lcd-domains.h (above), and the test
cases in arch/x86/lcd-domains/tests/ for more info.

========================================
BUILD
========================================

main.c is built and linked via the arch-independent code make file inside
virt/lcd-domains/Makefile. This is safe for the recursive make because only 
one module - lcd-domains.ko - needs it.

No configuration is necessary.

========================================
INTERRUPTS
========================================

All external interrupts and exceptions cause VM exits. We do not ack 
external interrupts on vm exits (as before) because emulating interrupt
handling for 64-bit is too hard and maybe even impossible to do in software.
(We were using KVM's code before, but I think this is stale code that is never
run anymore, because KVM does not ack interrupts on vm exit.)

If you do allow an lcd to handle some interrupts, make sure the reschedule
interrupt still causes a vm exit. We are relying on this (as does KVM) for
forcing an lcd to exit so we can schedule a higher priority thread (notice
the cond_resched inside the arch-independent code). You can see the 
IRQ vectors for x86 inside arch/x86/include/asm/irq_vectors.h. The reschedule
vector is a very high priority vector.

========================================
EXAMPLE
========================================

Here is an example how to set up one lcd_arch, and run it, without
error checking:

struct lcd_arch *lcd_arch;
/*
 * Create the lcd_arch
 */
lcd_arch_create(&lcd_arch);

/* (...Allocate and map pages in the LCD using the ept functions...) */

/*
 * Set up the lcd_arch's program counter, stack pointer, etc.
 */
lcd_arch_set_pc(lcd_arch, some_gva);
lcd_arch_set_sp(lcd_arch, some_gva);
lcd_arch_set_gva_root(lcd_arch, some_gpa);

/*
 * Run it
 */
lcd_arch_run(lcd_arch);

/*
 * Tear down the LCD
 */
lcd_arch_destroy(lcd_arch);


========================================
ADDRESS SPACES
========================================

One of the hardest, error-prone, confusing parts of this is we need to keep
track of four different kinds of addresses:

   (1) host physical
   (2) host virtual
   (3) guest physical
   (4) guest virtual

We have created four different data types (much like those used for
page tables -- pte_t, pmd_t, ...):

   (1) host physical    hpa_t
   (2) host virtual     hva_t
   (3) guest physical   gpa_t
   (4) guest virtual    gva_t

and routines for converting between them. Some conversions are not supported
directly, and must be done with more work -- e.g., guest physical to host
virtual requires an EPT. But some, like host physical to host virtual, can
be done using host macros. See the arch header.

Host physical addresses need to be stored in the EPT.

Guest physical addresses need to be stored in the guest virtual page tables.
>>>>>>> Support for multiple threads in lcd (limited). Major clean up of code.


==============================
LOCKING
==============================

TODO: Some of the arch code is not thread safe.

Locks are initialized but not yet used for the lcd_arch's ept.

We use mutexes for now, so some functions are not safe to call from
interrupt context (we can sleep when we lock a mutex).

This makes debugging easier since we can interrupt locks (no deadlocks).

==============================
GDT/TSS/IDT
==============================

We will need GDT/TSS/IDT in the future when we provide full support for running
multiple threads inside an LCD, and if those threads are handling some
exceptions/interrupts (like guest virtual page faults).

When an LCD thread is spawned, the creator should provide 4 pages of memory:

     -- 1 for thread's stack/utcb
     -- 1 for its gdt
     -- 1 for its tss
     -- 1 for its idt

The IDT/GDT could be shared by threads, but it might be complicated, and the
microkernel would have to make certain assumptions or enforce certain polices
to protect itself (e.g., if it needed to modify the IDT/GDT when setting up
a new thread). Having a TSS per thread makes some sense - a thread here is more
like a logical core - and this is what Linux does.

I'm putting the gdt / tss init code here for reference since it was quite
complicated to do (some of the macros won't be relevant anymore):

	/*

	lcd->gdt = (struct desc_struct *)get_zeroed_page(GFP_KERNEL);
	if (!lcd->gdt) {
