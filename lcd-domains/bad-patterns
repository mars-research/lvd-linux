1 - A pointer points to a struct embedded inside another struct. It's difficult
or impossible to wrap that other struct in a container, because it changes
the layout of the struct it's inside. (It only makes sense to have one
container per memory chunk.) However, it's then hard for glue to know
whether the struct is embedded or not.

2 - The callee might try to use "current", including mm related stuff. This
assumes that the calling thread is the same as the original thread that
started off the call sequence. This may not be true if we have other threads
handling calls/replies. It may not be simple to switch "current", so it might
require some code modification of callee.

3 - The caller may pass a global variable as an argument to a function. But
the global variable is defined on the callee side. Could add a "getter". But
when does callee insert global variable into caller's cspace? Perhaps it checks
if ref is non-null already (insert already done).

4 - Tracking the percolation of shared, stateful objects is hard.

5 - Handling error scenarios is hard. For example, consider LCD A and B. B
does an rpc to A, and something happens inside A that causes an error. So
A returns an error status to B. Perhaps B wants to do *additional* rpc's
on A because of the error. A needs to be ready to handle those error-scenario
rpc's, or else B will just sit there waiting.
