Outstanding Issues
========================================

-- Some code uses the "constructor" (ctor) feature for slab caches. This is
   only called once when a cache grows, and there is no matching
   "destructor" when a cache shrinks. For an example, see the notes for
   the glue code for VFS::init_inode_once.

========================================
VFS Loop
========================================

Need to have a thread running/listening on non-isol VFS side. Set that 
up, etc.

========================================
Glue code containers in original code
========================================

Glue code expects objects that pass through the interface boundary
to be wrapped in container structs. We have to identify what those
objects are that pass through interfaces (many objects are internal
to the subsystem, so it's not necessary to do this).

PMFS (and other modules) will often wrap interface objects within 
*their own* container structs. So, our container needs to wrap around 
*their container* to preserve backward compatability.

Also, the caller or the callee can allocate interface objects. For example,
during mount, filesystems typically call the mount_bdev/mount_nodev helper
functions in the vfs in super.c. These helper functions will ultimately
allocate a struct super_block (in the case of mount_bdev, if one does 
not already exist for the device).

IDL notes: it doesn't seem like there's an easy way to automate this
task (updating the original code to use glue code containers). Ideally,
original code uses helpers to access some of these structs we're wrapping
in containers, so we can just update the helpers. We *may* be able to automate 
deciding which structs are caller/callee alloc'd.

PMFS-Side Allocs
----------------

-- struct pmfs_inode_vfs
   -- defined in fs/pmfs/pmfs.h
   -- solution: use anonymous struct type in super.c (so we don't introduce
      a name dependency inside the original pmfs code) when we create the
      slab cache, and update the alloc/free helpers to unpack the
      pmfs_inode_vfs from our glue container struct. The anonymous container
      struct will add two 64-bit fields that the glue will use to hold
      remote references (one for the vfs remote copy, and one for pmfs's
      own copy)
   -- updated:
      -- fs/pmfs/super.c:init_inodecache
      -- fs/pmfs/super.c:pmfs_alloc_inode
      -- fs/pmfs/super.c:init_once (involved in alloc)
      -- fs/pmfs/super.c:pmfs_i_callback (involved in dealloc)

PMFS --> VFS Calls TODO
========================================

-- init_inode_once
   -- called in fs/pmfs/super.c:init_once
   -- arg1 stateful: bind
   -- !!interesting - this is only called *once* for the entire lifetime
      of a page in the slab cache. This is a typical call path:

            VFS                            PMFS
            ---         |           |      ----

      sget {            |           |
                        |           |
           alloc_inode--|--.        |
                        |  \        |
      }                 |   '->-->--|-> alloc_inode {
                        |           |

                        |           |   }                           V
                        |           |                               |
                        |           |                               V
                        |           |                               |
                        |           |      .--<--<--<--<--<---------'
                        |           |      |
                        |           |   init_once {
                        |           |
    init_inode_once { <-|-<--<--<---|--<--- init_inode_once
                        |           |
          ...           |           |   }
                        |           |
    }                   |           |
                        |           |

      In the picture, init_once is only called if the cache alloc causes the
      cache to grow.
    
      My solution for now is to change the code in PMFS so that init_inode_once
      is called every time. (I considered some alternatives, but they seemed to
      require moving/copying the init_once from PMFS into the VFS glue == bad
      idea probably.)

   -- all of it (and the functions it calls) are initialization code
      and don't use any fields in the struct inode passed to it by
      pmfs (the caller)
   -- the immediate caller (fs/pmfs/super.c:init_once) doesn't use the
      inode, so it should be used under a lock (hopefully) and that's when
      we can sync data if necessary
   -- it may be wise to use a slab cache on the VFS side for the glue code
      container structs

-- bdi_init
   -- called in fs/pmfs/super.c:init_pmfs_fs
   -- arg1 stateful: alloc=caller, lifetime=PMFS LCD lifetime
   -- need to marshal two fields, no function pointers

-- register_filesystem
   -- called in fs/pmfs/super.c:init_pmfs_fs
   -- arg1 stateful: alloc=caller, lifetime=PMFS LCD lifetime
   -- pmfs LCD init needs to be given a remote ref to its struct module,
      and we need to create a glue container struct for a struct module,
      install the remote ref there (THIS_MODULE or __this_module needs to
      be redefined so it points to the struct module in the container)
   -- need to marshal remote ref to module, filesystem name
   -- need to set up caller/callee glue for function pointers ... but I think
      only mount (even though it just calls VFS::mount_nodev, it passes a
      function pointer). kill_sb == VFS::kill_anon_super, so we should be 
      able to call that directly from VFS (VFS will take a semaphore on 
      the super block, and we can maybe do cross-domain sync then).

-- bdi_destroy
   -- called in fs/pmfs/super.c:init_pmfs_fs,exit_pmfs_fs
   -- arg1 stateful: bind, dealloc=caller alloc'd (free glue container on
      VFS side)
   -- no fields to marshal

-- unregister_filesystem
   -- called in fs/pmfs/super.c:init_pmfs_fs,exit_pmfs_fs
   -- arg1 stateful: bind, dealloc=caller alloc'd
   -- no fields to marshal (we marshalled everything during register,
      and we didn't change anything during the life of the PMFS module, so
      VFS has everything it needs)

========================================
VFS --> PMFS Calls TODO
========================================

-- mount (function pointer in struct file_system_type that is passed
   in register_filesystem invocation)
   -- called in VFS - fs/super.c:mount_fs
   -- arg1 stateful (file system type): bind 
   -- arg2 marshal (flags): int arg 
   -- arg3 no marshal (dev name): not used by pmfs
   -- arg4 marshal (data - command line option string basically):
               copy raw data into message regs? probably

========================================
Macros
========================================

Modules define and use special macros that lead to conditional
compilation. For example, the PMFS module has CONFIG_PMFS_TEST
to toggle on/off building testing code.

It may be necessary to allow those macros to be toggled on/off
still when we build a module for isolation.
